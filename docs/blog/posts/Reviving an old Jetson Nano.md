# Reviving an old Jetson Nano and combine with with LLM development

I have had the Jetson Nano bought in 2020, the old version for sometime.  Something I picked up during COVID lock-down period
as a hobby interest.

Recently I decided to set it up as a Jetbot (refer here https://jetbot.org/master/), but found that Nvidia no longer maintain a consistent set of software for it, the updated software are mostly for the latest Jetson Orin Nano, and would not work with old one.
